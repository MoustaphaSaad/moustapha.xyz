Hello, I'm Moustapha Saad a graphics/compilers programmer. I usually work in C++ or C, but I also like Go, Odin, Zig, Rust, Smalltalk, etc..., you get the idea being a compiler programmer means I almost like all programming languages out there.

I have a deep passion for computer graphics and programming languages, be it designing libraries, tools, and programming languages to help solve problems for engineers or designers, or implementing new ways to rendering real-time big data.

I currently work at [360Imaging](https://360imaging.com/) as a C++/Medical Imaging Software Engineering Team Leader.
