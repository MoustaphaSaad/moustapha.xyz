I have been reading Drew DeVault's blog posts for more than 2 years now, and I'm liking it. I always like his minimal and straight to the point blog. And being the impressionable young man that I am I decided to do a weekly status update posts (on Sundays) just like Drew's monthly status updates.

I decided to make it weekly instead because I like short repeating habits, and I fail miserably when it comes to long term habits. The other reason is I'm trying to improve my english writing skills.

So yeah we'll be having a status update post next Sunday. YAY
