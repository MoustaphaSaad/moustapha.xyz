Hello,

I've decided to do a small fun experiment which is to go through Ray Tracing in One Weekend and implementing it in 3
different programming languages: C++, Golang, and Odin.

Why? you might ask, well I've only made a single ray tracer before and I wanted to evaluate a C++ alternative because
I want to spice things up a bit, and maybe I can get something cool at the end.

I predict that I will either like odin or golang (over C++) and use it to work on future fun projects.

This is the index post, let's see where we will end up:
- [Part 1: Disk I/O](./rtow-part-1.md)

That's all folks.
